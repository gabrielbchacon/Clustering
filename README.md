# Clustering

I wrapped all the clustering project in this rep. 

My highlight if the notebook called *[clustering-the-countries-by-k-means.ipynb](https://github.com/gabrielbchacon/Clustering/blob/main/clustering-the-countries-by-k-means.ipynb)* where I used k-means approach to cluster countries based on social economic metrics.
